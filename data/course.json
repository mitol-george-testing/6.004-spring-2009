  "course_description": "6.004 offers an introduction to the engineering of digital systems. Starting with MOS transistors, the course develops a series of building blocks \u2014 logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, finite-state machines, computers and finally complete systems. Both hardware and software mechanisms are explored through a series of design examples.\n\n6.004 is required material for any EECS undergraduate who wants to understand (and ultimately design) digital systems. A good grasp of the material is essential for later courses in digital design, computer architecture and systems. The problem sets and lab exercises are intended to give students \"hands-on\" experience in designing digital systems; each student completes a gate-level design for a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor during the semester.\n",
